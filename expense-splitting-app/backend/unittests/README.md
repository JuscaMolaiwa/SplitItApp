## Overview
The test suite is built using Python's unittest framework and targets the authentication module. It ensures:

- User registration functions properly.
- Login and token generation work seamlessly.
- Access control decorators like login_required and admin_required are enforced correctly.

## Setup
- Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SplitItApp.git

cd expense-splitting-app
```
- Create a Virtual Environment
- Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```
python -m venv venv
```
- Activate the Virtual Environment
  - On macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
   - On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install Dependencies
Install the required packages, including Flask and testing libraries, using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set Environment Variables
Ensure any required environment variables (e.g., FLASK_ENV, DATABASE_URL) are set. You can use a .env file or set them directly in your shell.

### Running Unit Tests
Run the unit tests with:

```
python -m unittest discover -s unittests -p "test_*.py"
```

## For more detailed output, use the verbose flag:

```
python -W ignore -m unittest discover -s unittests -p "test_*.py" -v
```
## Tests Included
  - Authentication Tests
    - get_current_user_id:
    - Validates decoding of valid tokens.
    - Handles cases where no token is provided.
  - Registration
    - Tests successful user registration.
    - Validates error handling for missing or invalid fields.
  - Login
    - Verifies successful login and token generation.
    - Ensures graceful handling of invalid credentials.
- Decorators
    - admin_required:
        - Tests behavior for admin and non-admin users.
    - login_required:
        - Validates access control for authenticated and unauthenticated users.

## Mocking
The test suite employs mocking to isolate unit test behavior. Commonly mocked elements include:

- Database interactions
- Token decoding and validation
- JSON responses (flask.jsonify)
- This ensures tests run independently without relying on external services.
